In this project, I implemented a simple task-manager. To start this project locally you need write some simple commands:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

If you want to create more data just login by this superuser data : username : admin password: 1qazcde3
